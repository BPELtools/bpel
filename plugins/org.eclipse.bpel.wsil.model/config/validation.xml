<!-- Very simple validation rules

The event name is the internal event id that is fired by various elements, project,
or editor. The way it works is as follows:

- upon being fired, the "rule engine" will determine to see if anything needs to be validated.
- The validate tag may have multiple entries and will denote the chunk of validations
  that will take place in a single "thread". Different validate tags will imply
  different threads that will be used to validate.
- if a bpel element is the source of the event, then all the descendants of that element
  that match the classes will be validated.
- note that validation is done by calling the method ._validate() on the BPELElement.
- to introduce validation, define it in the typedef.*.xml file for the right type of element type
- if timeout is missing, 1000 ms (1 second) is assumed.
